It transcends the limitations of monolithic chatbots by utilizing a cognitive architecture where multiple \"experts\" work in harmony, governed by a central Orchestrator.\n\n## **🧠 System Architecture**\n\nThe design of CareerMatrix AI follows a robust, MLOps-ready architecture, organized into three key layers:\n\n1. The Agent Layer (The Experts)\nA collection of specialized LLM instances (e.g., Resume Specialist, Interview Coach) where each agent has a unique prompt, role, and output format tailored to a specific career domain.\n\n2. The Orchestration Layer (The Conductor)\nThe central Orchestrator component that intelligently receives the user's query and performs Heuristic Routing—analyzing keywords and context to select the single best agent for the job, ensuring the most precise advice is given.\n\n3. The Observability & Memory Layer (The Foundation)\nThe Memory class stores all conversation history and session-specific data (Mood Log, Timeline). This provides the Context Engineering necessary for personalized advice.\n\nThe Observatory class tracks system health, logging agent usage, errors, and overall performance, essential for MLOps and reliability.\n\n![WF.png](attachment:88737be7-801b-41ab-b0f6-85ec4a7bfb09.png)\n\n## **🤝 Meet the Agent Team**\n\nThe system is powered by six core agents, each ready to serve a different aspect of the user's career journey.\n\n### **1.Q&A Specialist**\n\nKey Functionality:General, comprehensive career questions and practical advice.\nExample Query:\"What is the future of AI in finance?\"\n\n### **2.Resource Curator**\n\nKey Functionality:Filters and recommends high-quality courses, articles, and books.\nExample Query:\"What are the best free courses to learn PyTorch?\"\n\n### **3.Career Advisor**\nKey Functionality:Personalized long-term guidance, path planning, and transition strategies.\nExample Query:\"How should I negotiate a 15% salary increase for a Senior ML role?\"\n\n### **4.Resume Specialist**\nKey Functionality:Review and optimization of resumes/CVs for ATS and clarity.\nExample Query:\"Review my CV and suggest improvements for a remote job.\"\n\n### **5.Interview Coach**\nKey Functionality:Preparation for technical and behavioral interviews.\nExample Query:\"Give me a mock interview for a Product Manager position.\"\n\n### **6.Career Simulator**\nKey Functionality:Runs a detailed, 1-week work-life simulation for any given job title.\nExample Query:\"Run a 1-week simulation for a startup CTO.\"\n\n### **7.Parallel Career Generator**\nKey Functionality:Hypothesizes three alternate career paths in different global realities.\nExample Query:\"Suggest three parallel careers based on my skills in coding and art.\"\n\n## **Core Features**\n\nCareerMatrix AI goes beyond basic Q&A by embedding specialized, high-value tools directly into the agent architecture.\n\n1. Multi-Agent Orchestration: The system's backbone, ensuring every query is routed to the optimal specialist (e.g., Resume, Interview, Advisor).\n\n2. Contextual Memory (Memory Class): Maintains conversation history and user-specific logs (mood, timeline entries) to provide truly personalized, long-term advice.\n\n3. 🎮 Career Simulation Sandbox: An immersive feature allowing users to role-play a one-week work cycle for any job title, detailing tasks, stress levels, and critical decision points.\n\n4. 🌌 Parallel Career Generator: A strategic feature that analyzes user data and suggests alternative career trajectories based on dramatic \"what-if\" scenarios (e.g., a drastically different economy).\n\n5. 📊 Career Mood & Identity Tracker: Tools to log subjective career feelings and key life events, transforming disparate data into a Unified Identity Statement and an analytical Mood Report.\n\n6. System Observability: The Observatory tracks agent activity, errors, and performance, demonstrating production-ready MLOps practices.\n\n\n## **Technical Implementation**\n\nThe system is a Python-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) demonstrating advanced LLM engineering and robust software design.\n\n### Technical Stack\n\n* LLM Engine: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash\n\n* Front-end Framework: Gradio\n\n* Core Libraries: google-generativeai, os, sys, json, datetime\n\n* Architecture Pattern: Multi-Agent System (MAS) with Heuristic Routing\n\n### Design Principles\n\n* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Clear separation of concerns into distinct classes (Memory, Observatory, Orchestrator, BaseAgent) for modularity and maintainability.\n\n* Context Engineering: Each agent's prompt is dynamically augmented with recent conversation history and user profile data for relevant responses.\n\n* Robust Configuration: Secure loading of the GEMINI_API_KEY via Kaggle Secrets.\n\n* Custom UI/UX: Extensive use of CSS within Gradio to create a visually distinct, professional, and highly engaging interface.\n\n## **How to Use CareerMatrix AI**\n\n🖥️ Web Interface with Gradio (Recommended)\n\nThe easiest and most engaging way to interact with the system is through the Gradio web interface launched below.\n\n## Why use the Gradio UI?\n\n* Immersive Experience: Access specialized feature tabs (Sandbox, Mood Tracker).\n\n* Agent Control: Easily override the Orchestrator's routing using the Specialized Agent Override dropdown.\n\n* Visual Feedback: Clear display of which agent answered your query (e.g., \"👤 [Artheris - Resume Specialist]\").\n\n💻 Command Line Interface (Conceptual)\n\nWhile this notebook focuses on the Gradio UI, the underlying Python classes (CareerAssistanceSystem and Orchestrator) are designed to be callable programmatically, enabling easy integration into backend systems or terminal applications.\n\n## **Real-World Applications**\n\n1.Corporate L&D\n\nUse Case:Scaling personalized coaching for employees undergoing career transitions.\nAgent/Feature:Career Advisor, Resource Curator\n\n2.University Career Services\n\nUse Case:Providing 24/7 mock interviews and instant resume feedback to a large student body.\nAgent/Feature:Interview Coach, Resume Specialist\n\n3.HR/Recruitment Tech\n\nUse Case:Analyzing candidate profile statements (Timeline) to generate fast, accurate fit assessments.\nAgent/Feature:Identity Tracker, Parallel Career Generator\n\n## **Getting Started**\n\n### **Installation Steps**\n\nThe project requires only a few core Python packages, which are automatically installed at the start of the notebook if missing:\n\nInstallation is handled automatically in the first code cell:\nos.system(f\"{sys.executable} -m pip install -q google-generativeai gradio\")\n\n### **Prerequisite: Gemini API Key**\n\nThis system requires a Gemini API Key to run the LLM agents.\n\n## **Process to create a new API key in Google AI Studio**\n\n1.Navigate to Google AI Studio.\n\n2.Log in with your Google account.\n\n3.Click \"Create API Key\" and copy the generated key string.\n\n## **Process to add the created API key to Kaggle secrets**\n\n1.In your Kaggle notebook, click the Secrets tab (often located on the right side of the editor).\n\n2.Click \"Add a new secret.\"\n\n3.Set the Name of the secret to GEMINI_API_KEY (case-sensitive).\n\n4.Paste the key you copied from AI Studio into the Value field.\n\n5.Check the box to \"Attach\" the secret to the notebook.\n\n## **👇 Run the Cell Below to Launch Gradio Web Interface**\n\n**Note:** You are asked to add secrets to your notebook while you copy and edit the notebook. The system will automatically attempt to load the GEMINI_API_KEY from your attached secrets.\n\n\n\n## 💻 Get Started\nSet your Gemini API Key as a Kaggle Secret named GEMINI_API_KEY.\n\n## Run the
